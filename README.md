# CMSY Multi Species forecast
Multi species forecasting method based on the CMSY stock assessment method's output. The CSV files report examples of inputs to the method, e.g. for multiple species (Out_March062019_O_Stocks_ID_19_Med.csv), single species (Out_March062019_O_Stocks_ID_19_Med_single.csv), aggregated groups of species (Out_Ukr_ID.csv).

which assumes that F/Fmsy can be set for all species to a fixed value (e.g. 0.5, 0.8, 0.95) for the forecast years.

which assumes that F/Fmsy can be set for all species to a portion of the value in the latest year (e.g. 0.5 F_latest_year/Fmsy, etc.) for the forecast years.
